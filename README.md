# Contact-Card-Application

This is a simple contact list app to be used as a local backup. The user will be able to store a contacts first name, last name, email, phone number, and an optional image. Once basic functionality is establish, third party APIs will be introduced. The primary third party API will be Twilio. The Twilio API will enable users to make calls and send text messages. This additional will transform the basic contact list app into a messaging platform. For contributions, please send a message and/or create a pull request for the Harlem Traveler team to review.
